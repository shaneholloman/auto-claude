"""
Workspace Management - Per-Spec Architecture
=============================================

Handles workspace isolation through Git worktrees, where each spec
gets its own isolated worktree in .worktrees/{spec-name}/.

Key changes from old design:
- Each spec has its own worktree (not shared)
- Worktree path: .worktrees/{spec-name}/
- Branch name: auto-claude/{spec-name}
- Fixed: get_existing_build_worktree() now properly checks spec_name
- Fixed: finalize_workspace() skips prompts in auto_continue mode

Terminology mapping (technical -> user-friendly):
- worktree -> "separate workspace"
- branch -> "version of your project"
- uncommitted changes -> "unsaved work"
- merge -> "add to your project"
- working directory -> "your project"
